        Debug.Log("On a typical day in the realm of Summoner’s Rift, a strange disturbance appeared from the sky. A pink ball crashed into the ground and created a shockwave that shook the residents. The champions woke up to find an unexpected visitor among them. It was Kirby, a cute pink ball with red shoes from Planet Popstar. Kirby blinked his eyes in confusion as he found himself in Summoner’s Rift, surrounded by towering structures and peculiar creatures. Unfazed by the strangeness of his new surroundings, Kirby felt his stomach growling, aching to satisfy itself. He waddled across the battlefield, attracting the attention of champions, minions, jungle monsters, and even epic monsters. Meanwhile, the champions were also confused by Kirby’s sudden appearance. Some were wary and unsure of Kirby’s intentions, while others adored him as if they were charmed by Ahri. As chaos erupted on the battlefield, with team fights breaking out between the opposing teams, Kirby found himself drawn to the most powerful monster on the Rift, Baron Nashor. Kirby approached the fearsome creature residing at the topside river. With great force, Kirby inhaled deeply, causing him to swell massively in size. And with a powerful suck, he vacuumed Baron Nashor towards his mouth, shocking the two junglers who were watching from the bushes. The champions stared in disbelief as Kirby slurped the Baron like a noodle. After successfully consuming Baron, he appeared bulged from his massive meal and bounced happily across mid-lane to the bottom river, straight towards the dragon pit. After also consuming the Elder Dragon, Kirby let out a satisfied burp before falling asleep. No one dared to approach Kirby after the incident, so the League champions left him alone. After a day, a portal resembling Ryze’s ultimate appeared under sleeping Kirby, transporting him to a different world. As if Kirby had never come to Summoner’s Rift, the champions awoke to start another day of clashing.");
